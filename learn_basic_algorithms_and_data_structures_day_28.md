# Coding Tip #28: Learn Basic Algorithms and Data Structures

As a beginner, understanding the basics of algorithms and data structures is crucial. This will help you write more efficient code and understand how the underlying systems work.

**Tip**: Start by learning about arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, and sorting algorithms.

Example:
```js
// Bubble Sort Example
function bubbleSort(arr) {
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - i - 1; j++) {
      if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
        [arr[j], arr[j + 1]] = [arr[j + 1], arr[j]];  // Swap
      }
    }
  }
  return arr;
}

console.log(bubbleSort([5, 3, 8, 4, 2]));
```
