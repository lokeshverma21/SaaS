# Coding Tip #32: Understand Scope and Closures in JavaScript

Understanding scope and closures is crucial for writing clean and efficient JavaScript code. Scope refers to the visibility of variables within different parts of your program, while closures are functions that remember the scope in which they were created.

**Tip**: Learn how local, global, and block scope work to avoid unexpected behavior.

Example:
```js
// Example of function scope
function outer() {
  const outerVar = 'I am from the outer scope';
  function inner() {
    console.log(outerVar); // inner function has access to outerVar due to closure
  }
  inner();
}

outer();  // "I am from the outer scope"
```

Closures allow inner functions to access variables from the outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing. This feature is useful for creating private data and encapsulating functionality.

Example of private data using closures:
```js
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return {
    increment: function() {
      count++;
      return count;
    },
    decrement: function() {
      count--;
      return count;
    }
  };
}

const counter = createCounter();
console.log(counter.increment()); // 1
console.log(counter.increment()); // 2
console.log(counter.decrement()); // 1
```
