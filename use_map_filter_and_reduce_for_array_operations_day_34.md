# Coding Tip #34: Use Map, Filter, and Reduce for Array Operations

JavaScript arrays come with powerful methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` to manipulate and process data efficiently. These methods can often replace traditional loops for cleaner, more concise code.

**Tip**: Leverage these array methods to make your code more readable and functional.

- `map()` is used to transform each element in an array.
- `filter()` is used to remove unwanted elements from an array.
- `reduce()` is used to accumulate a value based on the elements in an array.

Example:
```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

// map() - Doubles each number in the array
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

// filter() - Filters out numbers greater than 3
const greaterThanThree = numbers.filter(num => num > 3);
console.log(greaterThanThree); // [4, 5]

// reduce() - Adds all the numbers together
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
```

These methods are highly expressive, making it clear what the code is doing without the need for extra comments or verbose loops.

Example: Using `reduce()` for a more complex operation like summing up values:
```js
const transactions = [
  { amount: 200 },
  { amount: -50 },
  { amount: 300 },
  { amount: -100 }
];

const balance = transactions.reduce((acc, transaction) => acc + transaction.amount, 0);
console.log(balance);  // 350
```
