# Coding Tip #30: Practice Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (regex) are incredibly useful for matching patterns in strings. Understanding regex can save you a lot of time in text parsing, validation, and extraction.

**Tip**: Start with basic patterns and build up your regex skills over time.

Example:
```js
// Regular expression to match an email address
const emailRegex = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,6}$/;

// Test the regex with a valid email
console.log(emailRegex.test('example@example.com'));  // true
```
