## ❤️ Why This Repo Exists

As developers, we often stumble upon tiny tricks that make a huge difference —  
maybe a terminal command that saves hours, or a React hook pattern that feels like magic.  

But we usually forget them or bury them deep in our notes.  
This repo aims to **collect those gems** in one place — to share, remember, and celebrate the small wins.  

> “Sometimes, a 2-line tip can save you 2 hours of debugging.” — Someone wise (probably a tired dev)
