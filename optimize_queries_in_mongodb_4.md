# Coding Tip #4: Optimizing Queries in MongoDB

MongoDB can handle large datasets efficiently, but poor query practices can lead to performance issues. Indexing your database fields properly can significantly reduce query times.

**Tip**: Always index fields that are frequently queried, and make sure your queries are optimized to reduce unnecessary data fetching.

Example:
```js
// Create an index on the 'email' field to speed up searches
db.users.createIndex({ email: 1 });

// Use efficient queries
const user = await db.users.findOne({ email: 'john@example.com' });
```
